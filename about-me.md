I'm an experienced polyglot programmer, free and open-source software
enthusiast and regular contributor from the Czech Republic, currently based in
England. I also cycle a lot (road, gravel, urban, fixed-gear, unicycle), read
books, listen to music and taste beers.

If you're considering contacting me about a job offer, you should [read what
I'm really like]({{ "/real-me/" | relative_url }}) first.
