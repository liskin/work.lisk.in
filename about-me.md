I'm a polyglot programmer with almost two decades of experience in the
industry, free and open-source software enthusiast and regular contributor
from the Czech Republic, currently based in England. I also cycle a lot (road,
gravel, urban, fixed-gear, unicycle), inline skate (urban, endurance), read
books, listen to music and taste beers.
