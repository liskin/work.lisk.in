    Experienced polyglot programmer, FOSS enthusiast and contributor.

I'm an experienced polyglot programmer, free and open-source software
enthusiast and regular contributor from the Czech Republic[^tld], currently
based in England. Coding professionally since 2002.

[^tld]:
    Despite the <tt>.in</tt> TLD. It's <tt>lisk.in</tt> because my GitHub
    handle is [<tt>liskin</tt>][github-liskin].

If you believe you might want to hire me, check my
[GitHub][github-liskin]{:rel="me"} and [LinkedIn][linkedin-pivnik]{:rel="me"}
profiles and the following sections about my [strengths](#strengths) and
[quirks](#quirks) to get a better idea whether we'd be a good fit[^contact].

[^contact]:
    If you decide that indeed we are a good fit, feel free to [contact][] me
    directly. I don't mind LinkedIn, but the signal-to-noise ratio there is
    awful, so contacting me directly (and possibly hinting that you've read
    this) may be better.

## Strengths

* Solid background in Computer Science, studied[^study-results] at [Masaryk
  University][fi-muni] and [Universität Wien][univie].

* Polyglot and polyparadigm. The languages I actively use today are (in
  alphabetical order): [Bash][], [C][], [Elixir][], [Erlang][], [Haskell][],
  [JavaScript][], [Perl][], [Python][].

  On top of that, in the past I've used [C++][], [Java][], [Prolog][],
  [Scala][], [TeX][], and I can pick these up in no time.

  With the exception of Prolog, I've used all the mentioned languages in a
  professional setting.

* I know a lot about [git][], [Linux][], [IRC][], [Jenkins][], [docker][],
  [PostgreSQL][] (and [SQL][] in general), [X11 window management][],
  [(La)TeX][TeX], [bicycles][].

* Regular contributor to [free and open-source software][FOSS]. My [GitHub
  Resume][] lists my recent contributions and projects, and my [Open Hub
  profile][] includes contributions before/outside GitHub. I've had my fixes
  merged to the [Linux kernel][Linux], [X11][xorg], [Vim][], and many other
  projects. Despite mainly focusing on [my own projects][gh-repos] and
  submitting fixes all around, I got trusted with a commit bit in
  [fluxbox][], [xmonad][], [jenkins-job-builder][][^not-involved-anymore].

* I'm deliberate about [technical debt][]: embrace it when building a
  prototype, watch it (measure and track) when maintaining a production
  codebase, actively reduce it when taking over a neglected codebase.

  This approach enables me to build products that sustain long-term
  maintenance and still be friends[^violent-psychopath] with those maintaining
  it now.

* Instead of only treating symptoms (and, usually, increasing technical debt),
  I advocate finding the real [root cause][] and treating that. Similarly, I
  always try to understand what I'm doing by reading manpages, reference
  docs and possibly source code, and not [program by coincidence][].

* It follows from the above two points that I prefer a proactive approach to a
  reactive one. Operating in reactive mode outside of short-term crises is
  unhealthy and I'll avoid such environments.

* Whenever appropriate (i.e. not building a prototype[^prototype-prod] or
  similar limited-use product), I value following good security practices,
  conforming to standards and other forms of doing things “the right way”, and
  I keep many of these in working memory, so it's not much of a burden.

* I can switch between being a [maker][makers-menders] and being a
  [mender][makers-menders], recognize where others lie on this spectrum, and
  tell what projects are (in)appropriate for whom[^makers-maintenance].

* When my code breaks in the middle of the night, I fix it, and I make pretty
  damn sure it doesn't happen again. I don't need on-call bonuses, I prefer to
  sleep well. Naturally, I try to avoid being on call for big chunks of code
  outside my control, as I can't ensure my undisturbed sleep then.

[^study-results]:
    My study results: [Bachelor's degree programme][study1], [Master's degree
    programme][study2]. Dropped out at the end. Didn't get the degree, only
    the knowledge.

[^not-involved-anymore]:
    No longer involved in some of these.

[^violent-psychopath]:
    [Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a
    violent psychopath who knows where you
    live.](https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-for-violent-psychopaths/)

[^prototype-prod]:
    Don't you dare run that prototype in production.

[^makers-maintenance]:
    It's really painful to watch [makers][makers-menders] trying to mend their
    prototype in production…

## Quirks

* Not [neurotypical][]: suspected ADHD (attention inconsistency),
  self-medicated with beer, coffee, exercise and afternoon naps.

* The performance difference between my motivated self and my unmotivated self
  is hundredfold. If you manage to get me excited about something[^exciting],
  I'll run circles around your 10x devs. If you don't, I might as well take an
  unpaid vacation.

  The consequence of this is that a full-time 9 to 5 arrangement won't work
  for either of us.

* Long, boring all-hands “meetings” (actually presentations) drive me crazy
  (literally). If effective written communication isn't part of your company
  culture, I'm a bad fit.

  I still value meaningful in-person interactions: brainstorming with a
  whiteboard or over a beer is hard to replace.

* Obsessive about hardware/software choice. I need my [7-row ThinkPad
  keyboard][thinkpad-25], and I can't be expected to install corporate spyware
  of any kind. If you don't trust me to keep my laptop secure, why would you
  trust the code I write for you? By the way, the last time I had to reinstall
  Debian on my laptop was 2005 (netinst was 3 floppies back then).

  Unsurprisingly, I'm a strong advocate of [free and open-source
  software][FOSS]. I believe all software (and ideally also hardware) should
  be fixable by users.

* I use [Vim][]. I believe [tabs are fine][tabs] (but I don't really care,
  consistency is more important anyway). I prefer [IRC][], and yeah, I'm [that
  _one_ guy from xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1782/) (my IRC client handles
  [Slack][] threads fine, though).

* Road/gravel/urban/fixed-gear/uni [cyclist][strava-profile]{:rel="me"}.
  Against cars in cities. Still better driver than many, though.

* Not ready to relocate, I live with my [wife][] near her
  [university][eva-uni]. Once the [world returns to (new) normal][COVID-19],
  monthly travel to socialize/hack together is not a problem, and in fact
  quite welcome.

* May need a sabbatical every few years. Took unpaid sabbaticals in 2014 and
  2020.

[^exciting]:
    I tend to get excited about things I believe are really useful. The
    shorter the feedback loop, the easier it is for me to see that something
    is useful.

    Do I use it? Useful. Does it benefit my wife's research? Useful. Do random
    people in the pub use it and ask me to fix something, and I can actually
    help them? Definitely useful.

    On the other hand, if your idea of product management and motivation
    revolves around monthly all-hands presentations with pie charts and
    personas, or something that's effectively isomorphic to that, I'm a bad
    fit.

    I _need_ short feedback loops.
